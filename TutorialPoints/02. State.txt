001. State is immutable Therefore nothing can be pushed in the array eg. tasks.push(task) 

002. State should be declared at a top-level, therefore it must be in the APP.js

  *- App.js

  import { useState } from 'react'
  import Header from './components/Header'
  import Tasks from './components/Tasks'

  function App() {
    const [tasks, setTask] = useState([

      {
        id: 1,
        text: 'Grocery Shopping',
        day: 'November 4th at 10:00am',
        reminder: true,
      },
      {
        id: 2,
        text: 'School Meeting',
        day: 'November 5th at 4:00pm',
        reminder: true,
      },
      {
        id: 3,
        text: 'Town hall Election',
        day: 'November 8th at 9:00am',
        reminder: false,
      },
    ])

    return (
      <div className="container">
        <Header />
        <Tasks tasks={tasks} />
      </div>
    );
  }

  export default App;

  003. States are passed down from App.js to   Tasks.js & Task.js
  Actions are passed up from Task.js to Tasks.js & App.js
